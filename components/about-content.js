        , an organisation trying to help people track and reduce their carbon
        emissions, as an iOS developer. <br />
        <br /> previously I interned with GE Healthcare as a Data Scientist in
        their services department. I was also the organiser for
        TEDxIIITBangalore’s very first TEDx event, along with my colleague Tejas
        Kotha. We both are now mentors for the executive team. <br />
        <br />
        When I’m not working, I like writing, designing stuff on Sketch,
        rendering weird products on my potato MacBook Pro or rewatching clips
        from The Office for the millionth time. <br />

        Feel free to get in touch with me for freelance work, questions or a
        quick chat. I’m active on Twitter and strive to maintain inbox zero!
